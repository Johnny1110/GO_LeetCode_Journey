## Thinking

Given a reference of a node in a connected undirected graph.

Return a deep copy (clone) of the graph.

Each node in the graph contains a value (int) and a list (List[Node]) of its neighbors.

<br>

Graph Properties:

* Undirected (edges work both ways)
* Connected (all nodes are reachable from the given node)
* No duplicate edges or self-loops

<br>

**This problem combines two fundamental CS concepts:**

1. Graph Traversal:
   We need to visit every node in the original graph exactly once. Think about it: How do you explore an unknown graph systematically?

2. The Mapping Problem:
   Here's the crucial insight: When we clone node A and it has a neighbor B, we need to connect the cloned A to the cloned B. But what if we haven't created the cloned B yet? Or what if we've already cloned B when we encounter it again through a different path?

<br>
<br>

### Deconstructing the Problem:

**Step 1: The Fundamental Challenge**

Consider this simple graph: `1 -- 2 -- 3` (where 1 connects to 2, and 2 connects to 3)

When we clone node 1:

* We create a new node 1'
* Node 1 has neighbor 2, so we need to add 2' as a neighbor of 1'
* But 2' doesn't exist yet! What do we do?

Question: What data structure would help us keep track of "original node → cloned node" mappings?

<br>

**Step 2: The Traversal Strategy**

* DFS (Depth-First Search): Go as deep as possible before backtracking
* BFS (Breadth-First Search): Explore all neighbors before going deeper

Question: For this cloning problem, does it matter which one we choose? What are the trade-offs?


<br>

**Step 3: Handling Cycles**

Graphs can have cycles. For example: `1 -- 2 -- 3 -- 1` (a triangle)

Question: What happens if we don't track which nodes we've already visited/cloned? Walk through what would happen starting from node 1.

<br>
<br>

### Algorithm Framework

1. Create a `map[*Node][*Node]` which is `Origin Node -> Clone Node`, if `map[*Node]` exist means we already created clone node for this origin Node.
2. Travel method using DFS
   * func dfs(originNode *Node) cloneNode *Node {...}: 
     * If input originNode already cloned(exists in the map), just return it.
     * If input originNode not clone yet, create cloneNode and put it into `map[*Node][*Node]`.
       * Iterate through all neighbors:
         * call dfs(neighbor) to generate cloned neighbor node.
         * add cloned neighbor node into clone node's neighbors
       * return cloneNode as result. 

Let's try this ~

## Coding - DFS

```go
func cloneGraph(node *Node) *Node {
	if node == nil {
		return node
	}

	// 1. create a map for store existing cloneNode
	// origin node -> clone node
	cloneMap := map[*Node]*Node{}

	var dfs func(*Node) *Node
	dfs = func(originNode *Node) *Node {
		cloneNode, ok := cloneMap[originNode]
		if ok { // already cloned.
			return cloneNode
		} else { // not clone yet.
			// do clone, Neighbors is empty at first.
			cloneNode = &Node{
				Val:       originNode.Val,
				Neighbors: make([]*Node, len(originNode.Neighbors)),
			}

			// put clone node into cloneMap.
			cloneMap[originNode] = cloneNode

			// process Neighbors
			for i, neighbor := range originNode.Neighbors {
				cloneNeighbor := dfs(neighbor)
				cloneNode.Neighbors[i] = cloneNeighbor
			}

			return cloneNode
		}
	}

	return dfs(node)
}
```
