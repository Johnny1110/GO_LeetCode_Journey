## Topic 

* Array
* Divide and Conquer
* Sorting
* [Heap (Priority Queue)](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1Gm4y1S7yY/?spm_id_from=333.337.search-card.all.click&vd_source=9780a181ac9f1fee5f680f255ee5bc73)
* Quickselect

Constraints:

```
1 <= k <= nums.length <= 105
-104 <= nums[i] <= 104
```

<br>
<br>

## Thinking

We're using MIN-HEAP as Priority Queue, And we only need K length for Heap size.

K length of a MIN-HEAP, the HEAD element of the HEAP is **Kth Largest Element in an Array**
