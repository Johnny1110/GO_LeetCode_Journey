## Thinking

<br>

I think that one is pretty easy. just using 2 pointer. and I gonna init a temp to store the sum value of that k size window.

Each time moving both pointerA & B forward, add `nums[pointerB]` and also reduce `nums[pointerA-1]`

Let's try this out.

<br>
<br>

## Coding-1

```go
func maxSlidingWindow(nums []int, k int) []int {
	// k is window size, and we need calculate the first sum value of window.
	result := make([]int, len(nums)-k+1)

	windowSum := 0
	for i := 0; i < k; i++ {
		windowSum += nums[i]
	}
	result[0] = windowSum

	// make 2 pointers
	pointerA := 1
	pointerB := k

	for pointerB < len(nums) {
		// current val = previous val + pointerB - previous pointerA
		windowSum = windowSum + nums[pointerB] - abs(nums[pointerA-1])
		result[pointerA] = max(windowSum, result[pointerA-1])
		pointerA++
		pointerB++
	}

	return result
}

func abs(val int) int {
	if val < 0 {
		return -val
	} else {
		return val
	}
}
```

<br>

It's turn out that I misunderstand the problem description, I thought that was a sum problem.

I should only store the max element of the k size of window.

It's not that easy...

## Topic

* Array
* Queue
* Sliding Window
* Heap (Priority Queue)
* Monotonic Queue

<br>

How does queue work for solving this problem? That's the key point I think.

After I knew those topic, I still have no idea, let take more hint:

<br>
<br>

## Hint

1. How about using a data structure such as deque (double-ended queue)?
2. The queue size need not be the same as the windowâ€™s size.
3. Remove redundant elements and the queue should store only elements that need to be considered.
