> Given the root of a binary tree, determine if it is a valid binary search tree (BST).

<br>

## Thinking

A valid BST is defined as follows:

* The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys strictly less than the node's key.
* The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys strictly greater than the node's key.
* Both the left and right subtrees must also be binary search trees.

## Coding

```go
func isValidBST(root *TreeNode) bool {
    
}
```
