# Trapping Rain Water

<br>

----

<br>

## Desc

Given n non-negative integers representing an elevation map where the width of each bar is 1, 

compute how much water it can trap after raining.

<br>

Example 1:

![1](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2018/10/22/rainwatertrap.png)

```
Input: height = [0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1]
Output: 6
```

Explanation: The above elevation map (black section) is represented by array [0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1]. In this case, 6 units of rain water (blue section) are being trapped.

<br>

Example 2:

```
Input: height = [4,2,0,3,2,5]
Output: 9
```

<br>


Constraints:

```
n == height.length
1 <= n <= 2 * 104
0 <= height[i] <= 105
```
