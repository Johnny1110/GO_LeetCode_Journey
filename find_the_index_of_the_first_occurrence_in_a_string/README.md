Given two strings needle and haystack, return the index of the first occurrence of needle in haystack, or -1 if needle is not part of haystack.

<br>

Example 1:
```
Input: haystack = "sadbutsad", needle = "sad"
Output: 0
```
Explanation: "sad" occurs at index 0 and 6.
The first occurrence is at index 0, so we return 0.

<br>

Example 2:

```
Input: haystack = "leetcode", needle = "leeto"
Output: -1
```

Explanation: "leeto" did not occur in "leetcode", so we return -1.

<br>

Constraints:
```
1 <= haystack.length, needle.length <= 104
haystack and needle consist of only lowercase English characters.
```
