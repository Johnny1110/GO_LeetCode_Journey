---

<br>

breaking down the problem into smaller sub-problems, solve them and combine the results.

<br>

1. Divide: Split the `k` sorted linked lists into pairs and merge each pair.
2. Conquer: Recursively apply the merging step on each pair.
3. Combine: Merge the sorted linked lists from step 2 until only one sorted linked list remains.
